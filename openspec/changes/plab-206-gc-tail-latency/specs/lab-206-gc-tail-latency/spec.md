# Delta for lab-206-gc-tail-latency

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Performance question and falsifiable hypothesis
The laboratory SHALL state the question “How do allocation rate, live-set size and collector choice shape latency tails?” and the hypothesis “Collector labels alone do not predict latency; live set, allocation rate, heap sizing, barriers and workload phase determine p99 and p999 behavior.” before presenting results.

#### Scenario: Performance question and falsifiable hypothesis is satisfied
- GIVEN the laboratory introduction is rendered
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the performance mechanism, expected result and conditions that could disprove the hypothesis are visible
### Requirement: Mechanism-first explanation
The laboratory SHALL explain the relevant jvm runtime mechanism before exposing optimized source code.

#### Scenario: Mechanism-first explanation is satisfied
- GIVEN a learner starts the laboratory
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the theory and mechanism visualization precede benchmark conclusions
### Requirement: Java implementation track
The laboratory SHALL provide runnable Java implementations focused on G1, ZGC and Shenandoah where available, fixed heap sizing, allocation profiles and JFR GC evidence.

#### Scenario: Java implementation track is satisfied
- GIVEN the Java track is selected
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN source, build command, run command and correctness result are available
### Requirement: Rust implementation track
The laboratory SHALL provide runnable Rust implementations focused on Allocator behavior, Vec reuse, Box-heavy variants and explicit reclamation/drop timing.

#### Scenario: Rust implementation track is satisfied
- GIVEN the Rust track is selected
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN source, build command, run command and correctness result are available
### Requirement: Semantic equivalence
Compared Java and Rust variants SHALL use equivalent inputs, outputs and correctness guarantees, with intentional differences documented.

#### Scenario: Semantic equivalence is satisfied
- GIVEN a cross-language chart is displayed
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the equivalence contract and any non-equivalent behavior are visible
### Requirement: Controlled variant matrix
The laboratory SHALL include the controlled variants: low allocation/reuse, steady high allocation, bursty allocation, growing live set, collector matrix.

#### Scenario: Controlled variant matrix is satisfied
- GIVEN the benchmark matrix is built
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN each required variant is either measured or explicitly marked unsupported with a reason
### Requirement: Dataset and parameter coverage
The laboratory SHALL exercise these data profiles where applicable: object graph churn, message pipeline, retained cache.

#### Scenario: Dataset and parameter coverage is satisfied
- GIVEN full-profile benchmarks run
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the result artifacts identify the dataset and parameter values for every sample
### Requirement: Required measurements
The laboratory SHALL capture and correctly label: allocation rate, pause p50/p99/p999, throughput, CPU overhead, RSS, live set.

#### Scenario: Required measurements is satisfied
- GIVEN results are imported
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN units, aggregation, sample count and uncertainty metadata are present
### Requirement: Profiler and counter evidence
The laboratory SHALL attach relevant evidence from the repository-supported subset of JFR, GC logs, JMH gc profiler, async-profiler alloc, Criterion, heaptrack or equivalent.

#### Scenario: Profiler and counter evidence is satisfied
- GIVEN a mechanism claim is made
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN at least one evidence artifact supports or challenges the claim
### Requirement: Reproducible commands
The laboratory SHALL show exact correctness, smoke, full and profiler commands resolved from repository scripts.

#### Scenario: Reproducible commands is satisfied
- GIVEN a contributor opens reproduction instructions
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the commands and expected artifact locations are available
### Requirement: Environment provenance
Every persisted run SHALL include toolchain, source revision, CPU/architecture, OS/kernel and available topology/power metadata.

#### Scenario: Environment provenance is satisfied
- GIVEN a result set is displayed
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN its provenance is accessible without consulting chat history
### Requirement: No fabricated results
The laboratory SHALL reject publication data that lacks raw artifacts or was manually entered as a measured value.

#### Scenario: No fabricated results is satisfied
- GIVEN the site build processes a result set
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN unprovenanced measured values fail validation
### Requirement: Pitfall disclosure
The laboratory SHALL explicitly discuss these traps: tiny heaps chosen to manufacture pauses; different semantic workloads; calling Rust allocation-free by default; comparing throughput-only to latency collectors.

#### Scenario: Pitfall disclosure is satisfied
- GIVEN a learner reviews conclusions
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the limitations and common invalid interpretations are visible
### Requirement: Educational visualization
The laboratory SHALL provide data-driven or deterministic visualizations covering: allocation/live-set timeline, collector trade-off radar, pause percentile plot.

#### Scenario: Educational visualization is satisfied
- GIVEN a visualization is shown
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN a textual/table fallback communicates the same core result
### Requirement: Exercises and verification
The laboratory SHALL include at least one diagnosis exercise, one code-change exercise and one evidence-interpretation exercise with success criteria.

#### Scenario: Exercises and verification is satisfied
- GIVEN a learner completes an exercise
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the expected verification method is available separately from the initial prompt
### Requirement: Conclusion integrity
The conclusion SHALL distinguish observed evidence, mechanism-based interpretation and unproven inference.

#### Scenario: Conclusion integrity is satisfied
- GIVEN the result set changes materially
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the conclusion is marked for re-verification before retaining verified status
