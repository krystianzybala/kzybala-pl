# Delta for lab-402-memory-ordering-atomics

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Performance question and falsifiable hypothesis
The laboratory SHALL state the question “What correctness and performance guarantees do plain, opaque, acquire/release and sequentially consistent operations provide?” and the hypothesis “Weaker valid orderings can reduce fences and contention, but incorrect publication creates rare failures that benchmarks alone may not reveal.” before presenting results.

#### Scenario: Performance question and falsifiable hypothesis is satisfied
- GIVEN the laboratory introduction is rendered
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the performance mechanism, expected result and conditions that could disprove the hypothesis are visible
### Requirement: Mechanism-first explanation
The laboratory SHALL explain the relevant concurrency mechanism before exposing optimized source code.

#### Scenario: Mechanism-first explanation is satisfied
- GIVEN a learner starts the laboratory
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the theory and mechanism visualization precede benchmark conclusions
### Requirement: Java implementation track
The laboratory SHALL provide runnable Java implementations focused on Java Memory Model, VarHandle access modes, volatile, fences and jcstress validation.

#### Scenario: Java implementation track is satisfied
- GIVEN the Java track is selected
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN source, build command, run command and correctness result are available
### Requirement: Rust implementation track
The laboratory SHALL provide runnable Rust implementations focused on Ordering variants, happens-before reasoning, loom model checking and unsafe-cell boundaries.

#### Scenario: Rust implementation track is satisfied
- GIVEN the Rust track is selected
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN source, build command, run command and correctness result are available
### Requirement: Semantic equivalence
Compared Java and Rust variants SHALL use equivalent inputs, outputs and correctness guarantees, with intentional differences documented.

#### Scenario: Semantic equivalence is satisfied
- GIVEN a cross-language chart is displayed
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the equivalence contract and any non-equivalent behavior are visible
### Requirement: Controlled variant matrix
The laboratory SHALL include the controlled variants: plain broken publication demonstration, acquire/release publication, volatile/seq-cst publication, CAS loop, fence-based variant.

#### Scenario: Controlled variant matrix is satisfied
- GIVEN the benchmark matrix is built
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN each required variant is either measured or explicitly marked unsupported with a reason
### Requirement: Dataset and parameter coverage
The laboratory SHALL exercise these data profiles where applicable: single-slot mailbox, sequence flag plus payload, counter update.

#### Scenario: Dataset and parameter coverage is satisfied
- GIVEN full-profile benchmarks run
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the result artifacts identify the dataset and parameter values for every sample
### Requirement: Required measurements
The laboratory SHALL capture and correctly label: ops/s, failed CAS, instructions/fences, correctness outcomes, p99.

#### Scenario: Required measurements is satisfied
- GIVEN results are imported
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN units, aggregation, sample count and uncertainty metadata are present
### Requirement: Profiler and counter evidence
The laboratory SHALL attach relevant evidence from the repository-supported subset of JMH, jcstress, Criterion, loom, perfasm, cargo asm, perf stat.

#### Scenario: Profiler and counter evidence is satisfied
- GIVEN a mechanism claim is made
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN at least one evidence artifact supports or challenges the claim
### Requirement: Reproducible commands
The laboratory SHALL show exact correctness, smoke, full and profiler commands resolved from repository scripts.

#### Scenario: Reproducible commands is satisfied
- GIVEN a contributor opens reproduction instructions
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the commands and expected artifact locations are available
### Requirement: Environment provenance
Every persisted run SHALL include toolchain, source revision, CPU/architecture, OS/kernel and available topology/power metadata.

#### Scenario: Environment provenance is satisfied
- GIVEN a result set is displayed
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN its provenance is accessible without consulting chat history
### Requirement: No fabricated results
The laboratory SHALL reject publication data that lacks raw artifacts or was manually entered as a measured value.

#### Scenario: No fabricated results is satisfied
- GIVEN the site build processes a result set
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN unprovenanced measured values fail validation
### Requirement: Pitfall disclosure
The laboratory SHALL explicitly discuss these traps: using performance tests as correctness proof; mapping Java and Rust orderings mechanically; benchmarking an intentionally racy variant without isolation; omitting forbidden outcomes.

#### Scenario: Pitfall disclosure is satisfied
- GIVEN a learner reviews conclusions
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the limitations and common invalid interpretations are visible
### Requirement: Educational visualization
The laboratory SHALL provide data-driven or deterministic visualizations covering: happens-before graph, ordering/fence table, jcstress/loom outcome matrix.

#### Scenario: Educational visualization is satisfied
- GIVEN a visualization is shown
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN a textual/table fallback communicates the same core result
### Requirement: Exercises and verification
The laboratory SHALL include at least one diagnosis exercise, one code-change exercise and one evidence-interpretation exercise with success criteria.

#### Scenario: Exercises and verification is satisfied
- GIVEN a learner completes an exercise
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the expected verification method is available separately from the initial prompt
### Requirement: Conclusion integrity
The conclusion SHALL distinguish observed evidence, mechanism-based interpretation and unproven inference.

#### Scenario: Conclusion integrity is satisfied
- GIVEN the result set changes materially
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN the conclusion is marked for re-verification before retaining verified status
### Requirement: Native-Linux publication evidence
Publication measurements SHALL be collected exclusively on the dedicated native-Linux benchmark host through the unified evidence runner and its per-lab configuration, and the laboratory SHALL render an awaiting-native-linux-measurement state until such evidence is imported and reviewed.

#### Scenario: Native-Linux publication evidence is satisfied
- GIVEN the laboratory displays a measured result or renders before evidence import
- WHEN the laboratory is built, executed or reviewed
- THEN every displayed measurement traces to imported native-Linux evidence and pre-import builds show the awaiting state instead of numbers
